# Cix - A minimal CI for Nix

Cix is a project to make a minimal useful CI for use with Nix.
It watches repositories, runs any tests and builds listed in `nix flake check`, and reports the status back to your forge.
It is small, easy to setup (one static binary, and one json configuration file), but it should be useful to those (like me) who are daunted by the work needed to setup Hydra, but would like tests run and reported for personal projects.

A lot of simplicity is found by not storing logs and artefacts, and relying on Nix's reproducibility instead.
The Nix command to reproduce the results is attached to the status tick.
If you share a binary cache with the runner, you will share its results without needing to calculate them.

It is early days for Cix, but if you wish to try it, create a `config.json` similar to the following and run `nix run github:steeleduncan/cix -- config.json`

```
{
    "var": "$HOME/.cache/cix-var",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "branch": "main",
            "github": {
                "user": "steeleduncan",
                "repository": "cix",
                "statuspat": "a PAT with status permissions (and ideally nothing else) goes here"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The `statuspat` is technically optional, but the status tick in Github is currently the only way to view the results.
When generating the token, please allow only Read/Write permissions on Commit Statuses.
Cix doesn't do anything other than push a commit status, and it is safest not grant any permissions it would not need.

Cix will use git to pull the repositories over SSH, using whatever permissions are available in that context.

Please note that this is not, and never will be, a replacement for Hydra.
Cix is simpler to setup than Hydra, especially on non-NixOS machines, and it will serve many people's needs.
However Hydra is much more featured than Cix, presents its own Web UI, maintains artefact & log stores, and supports clustering build machines, none of which are planned for Cix.

Cix was inspired by [nix-simple-ci](https://github.com/ElvishJerricco/nix-simple-ci)

## Things Cix does

- **Watches repositories**
- **Runs tests** with `nix flake check`
- **Pushes a commit status to Github** so you can see if the tests are running, passed or failed
- **Catches up** Cix doesn't need to be online when the commit is made, so if you only have your machine on part the time, when it first checks it will enumerate and test all commits made since it was last on

Cix will run tests for every commit, not just the latest commit pushed. However it won't run tests for commits before it was activated

## Things Cix won't do

Nix and your code forge have almost everything needed for a useful CI system, so with Cix I am doing my best to keep it minimal and rely on Nix wherever possible
The features below are not, and will not be, supported

- **Store logs or artefacts** Nix is reproducible, you can generate these locally, or get them from a shared binary cache
- **Serve a web front end** Your code forge is used as the front end of cix, it will push statuses there

If you are looking for a fuller featured CI, I urge you to take a look at Hydra. It is tougher to setup, but it does everything you are likely to need.

## Roadmap - things I want to add to Cix

- [ ] **Success actions** essentially a `nix run` that is called on succeeding tests. This could be used for deploys
- [ ] **Non-status notifiers** Discord, email, some shell script. Any of these would be useful
- [ ] **Binary cache option** Part the reason I don't want to serve artefacts is that Nix can do this through aa binary cache, but a configuration option needs to be passed to the checks for this
- [ ] **Repository maintenance** GC, prune, etc. Cix works by keeping a local copy of the repository in the var folder specified in the config. Most likely this would need the occasional GC
- [ ] **Leave logs as a comment** It would be helpful if logs were left as a comment on the commit when tests fail
- [ ] **Parallel tests** I imagine Cix being used in situations where you want some CPU left spare (e.g. if it runs on your dev machine), but it would be nice to have an option to parallelise and run multiple tests/builds in parallel

## Things I would love a PR for

These are things I'd love to see in Cix, but that I am unlikely to need, and thus do myself, but I'd gladly accept PRs for these

- [ ] **Other code forges** I only have projects on Github and Bitbucket, but htere are many other code forges it would be great if Cix supported
- [ ] **Non-flake checks** Personally, I only ever use flakes with Nix, but there are non-flake approaches I am not familiar with
- [ ] **Non-SSH access** Currently Cix uses the git binary and any SSH credentials available to it to pull commits. There are other approaches, and it would be useful to include these

## Alternatives

Depending on your needs the following might be useful

- **Hydra** The classic Nix CI, full featured, and probably what you are looking for if you have demanding requirements, and the time to maintain it
- **[github-nix-ci](https://github.com/juspay/github-nix-ci)** Run your own Github Actions self hosted runners on NixOS to use the GHA UI and your own hardware

## `Config.json` format

- `var` (required) A path to a work folder where cix may store copies of the repositories
- `name` (optional) A name for this runner, reported in the comment on code forge commit
- `timeout` (optional) Job timeout in seconds (defaults to 15 mins)
- `repositories` (required) A list of repositories
    - `branch` (required) The branch to test
    - `github` (optional)
        - `user` (required) User name on Github
        - `repository` (required) Repository name for that users account
        - `statuspat` (optional) A pat with commit status read/write
    - `bitbucket` (optional)
        - `workspace` (required) The Bitbucket workspace name
        - `repository` (required) The Bitbucket repository slug
        - `token` (optional) A token with repository write permissions
    - `ssh` (optional)
        - `remote` (required) An ssh git url to pull commits from

Although `github`, `bitbucket`, `ssh` fields are all optional, you must have at least one per repository specified.
If more than one is specified the outcome is undefined.
